## What It Does
Our team at cmd-f 2023 hackathon @UBC wanted to create a web application where a user can receive their carbon footprint usage based on their energy consumption based on user inputs. The application would save user information and users would see the total carbon footprints generated by themselves, which are calculated by the application so that the results can alarm users awareness of the environment.  

## Tech Stack
React (Front-End), Django (Back-End), Git (Deployment), Figma (Design)

## Accomplishments our team is proud of 
We are a group of 3 girls, and this hackathon was the first ever hackathon they ever participated in for my 2 team members. We succeeded in creating an app and didn't give up until the end goal despite some difficulties, so now we have something in our hands!

## Challenges our team ran into
We tried to use two different not too compatible stacks - React and Django. The reason why we wanted to combine two as our tech stack is Liz didn't have web development experience but python in data manipulation in her bioinformatics studies and I know how to build things in React. However, even though we tried hard and took a long time to figure this out, we couldn't find a solution for it, we decided to keep two separate programs we created in each of our specialties. Was a fun experience!
